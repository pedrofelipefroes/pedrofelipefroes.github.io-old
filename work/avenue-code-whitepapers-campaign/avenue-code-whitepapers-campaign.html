					Avenue Code is an IT consulting agency which strongly believes in sharing knowledge as a way to promote growth to itself and to its consultants. Its whitepaper campaign does just that: a consultant writes about a topic he's passionate about, and AC Design and Marketing teams get together to create a digital publication to share all of that passion.

						The campaign started out in September 2017 and is currently in its fourth installment. I had the pleasure to colaborate with the Design team to create the concept and graphics for its very first whitepaper, <em><strong>Microservices Architecture as a Large-Scale Refactoring Tool</strong></em>. In order to translate such IT concept into graphics, we've represented microservices refactoring as minor asteroids coming from a larger one, while the space-themed metaphor was an ode to the author's love for astronomy. Images were created through Sketch, and the text layout was done with Pages.

						<em><strong>Mobile Web, Hybrid, or Native: A Roadmap to the Right App</em></strong> is the campaign's third installment, which I've worked as its creative lead designer. For this one, we wanted to do something actual and trendy at the time, so I've created some isometric iPhone X models and played with color gel gradients around them.

						The latest iteration of the campaign launched in August 2018 with <em><strong>Machine Learning to Improve Software Engine Search Results</em></strong>. Typography played a big role in this one: the font Source Code Pro has all the programming vibes the subject needs but becomes pop when combined with the electric colors and the pop-art-esque dresses designed for the whitepaper. In addition, in order to translate the concept that machine learning can improve the recognition of similar products online, I've designed an animated piece to convey the "match!" idea, as seen below.
